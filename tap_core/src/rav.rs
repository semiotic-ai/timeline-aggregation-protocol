//! # Receipt Aggregate Voucher
//!
//! Receipts Aggregate Voucher or RAV is the struct that is sent to the
//! blockchain to redeem the aggregated receipts. Receipts are aggregated
//! into a single RAV via a [`RAVRequest`] and then sent to `tap_aggregator`.
//! The request is verified and signed by the aggregator and the response
//! is stored on the indexer side.
//!
//! Every time you have enough receipts to aggregate, you can send another
//! RAV request to the aggregator. The aggregator will verify the request and
//! increment the total amount that has been aggregated.
//!
//! Once the allocation is closed or anytime the user doesn't want to serve
//! anymore(sender considered malicious, not enough in escrow to cover the RAV, etc),
//! the user can redeem the RAV on the blockchain and get the aggregated amount.
//!
//! The system is considered to have minimal trust because you only need to trust
//! the sender until you receive the RAV. The value of non-aggregated receipts must
//! be less than the value you are willing to lose if the sender is malicious.
//!
//! # How to send a request to the aggregator
//!
//! 1. Create a [`RAVRequest`] with the valid receipts and the previous RAV.
//! 2. Send the request to the aggregator.
//! 3. The aggregator will verify the request and increment the total amount that
//!    has been aggregated.
//! 4. The aggregator will return a [`SignedRAV`].
//! 5. Store the [`SignedRAV`].
//! 6. Repeat the process until the allocation is closed.
//! 7. Redeem the RAV on the blockchain and get the aggregated amount.
//!
//! # How to create RAV Requests
//!
//! Rav requests should be created using the
//! [`crate::manager::Manager::create_rav_request`] function.
