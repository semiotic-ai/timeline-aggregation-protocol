//! Module containing Receipt type used for providing and verifying a payment
//!
//! Receipts are used as single transaction promise of payment. A payment sender
//! creates a receipt and ECDSA signs it, then sends it to a payment receiver.
//! The payment receiver would verify the received receipt and store it to be
//! accumulated with other received receipts in the future.
