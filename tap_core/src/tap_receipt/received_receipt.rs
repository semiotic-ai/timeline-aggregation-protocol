//! Module containing Receipt with metadata for tracking receipt throught its lifecycle
//!
//! This module contains the `ReceivedReceipt` struct and associated enums `ReceiptState` and
//! `RAVStatus`. The `ReceivedReceipt` struct is a wrapper class for a signed receipt, which
//! includes metadata and state information for tracking the progress of a received receipt
//! throughout its lifecycle. `ReceiptState` represents the different states a receipt can be in,
//! while `RAVStatus` defines the status of a receipt with respect to its inclusion in RAV requests
//! and received RAVs.
//!
//! This module is useful for managing and tracking the state of received receipts, as well as
//! their progress through various checks and stages of inclusion in RAV requests and received RAVs.
